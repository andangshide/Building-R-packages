   # git 
   Git is a version control system
   When a repository is under git version control, all the changes made in non-ignored file in a repository is saved
   (可以revert回之前的version)
   
    configure your version of git
    [from bash shell]
    git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
    git config --global user.email "jane.doe@university.edu"
    
    initialize a git repository
    [from bash shell]
    1. Use a shell (“Terminal” on Macs) to navigate to to that directory. You can use cd to do that (similar to setwd in R).
    2.Once you are in the directory, first check that it is not already a git repository. 
    To do that, run git status. If you get the message fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git, 
    it is not yet a git repository. If you do not get an error from git status, the directory is already a repository, 
    so you do not need to initialize it.
    3. If the directory is not already a git repository, run git in it to initialize it as a repository.
    
    ex.  to make a directory called “example_analysis”, which is a direct subdirectory of my home directory, a git repository, 
    cd ~/example_analysis
    git init
    
    [from R studio]
    1. Make the directory an R Project. If the directory is an R package, it likely already has an .Rproj file and so is an R Project. 
    If the directory is not an R Project, you can make it one from RStudio by going to “File” -> “New Project” -> “Existing Directory”, 
    and then navigate to the directory you’d like to make an R project.
    2. Open the R project.
    3. Go to “Tools” -> “Version Control” -> “Project Setup”.
    4. In the box for “Version control system”, choose “Git”.
    
    Commit changes
    [from R studio]
     click on the “Commit” button in the Git window. 
     
    link local repo to GitHub repo
    (From a bash shell, you can see files that start with . by running ls -a from within that directory.)
    1. In GitHub, click on the “+” in the upper right corner (“Create new”).
    2. Choose “Create new repository”.
    3. Give your repository the same name as the local directory you’d like to connect it to. 
       For example, if you want to connect it to a directory called “example_analysis” on your computer, 
       name the repository “example_analysis”. (It is not required for your GitHub repository name to be identical to 
       your local repository name, but it will make things easier.)
    4. Leave everything else as-is (unless you’d like to add a short description in the “Description” box). 
       Click on “Create repository” at the bottom of the page.
    
    connet two repos
    adding an SSH key from RStudio to your GitHub account 
    
    syncing
    1. Open a shell and navigate to the directory you want to push.
       (You can open a shell from RStudio using the gear button in the Git window.)
    2. Add the GitHub repository as a remote branch with the following command 
       (this gives an example for adding a GitHub repository named “ex_repo” in my GitHub account, “geanders”):
       git remote add origin git@github.com:geanders/ex_repo.git
    3. Push the contents of the local repository to the GitHub repository.
       git push -u origin master
    or 3. To pull a repository that already exists on GitHub and to which you have access
          (or that you’ve forked and so have access to the forked branch), first use cd from a bash shell on your personal 
          computer to move into the directory where you want to put the repository. Then, use the git clone function to clone
          the repository locally. 
          git clone git@github.com:janedoe/ex_repo.git
          
      pull request
      给他人的repo提建议
      Fork the repository
      1. Make changes (locally or on GitHub)
      2. Save your changes and commit them
      3. Submit a pull request to the original repository
      4. If there are not any conflicts and the owner of the original repository likes your changes, 
         he or she can merge them directly into the original repository. If there are conflicts, these need to be resolved before the
         pull request can be merged.
         
      merge conflicts
      ex.<<<<<<< HEAD
         mtcars[1, ]                             先pull的
         =======
         head(mtcars, 1)                         后pull的
         >>>>>>> remote-branch
         
      Ctrl-F：search for the conflict
      and change to 
      head(mtcars, 1)
