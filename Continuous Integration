the first is Travis which will test your package on Linux, and then thereâ€™s AppVeyor which will test your package on Windows.

Continuous integration is a strategy for testing new features and changes to your package as often as possible. 
Web services like Travis and AppVeyor make it possible to re-test your code on different platforms after every git push. 
Using continuous integration makes it easy for you and for others to simultaneously work on building an R package without 
breaking package features by mistake.
